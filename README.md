- 👋 Hi, I’m @ryancraig
- 👀 I’m interested in research and development of automated, secure infrastructure and software supply chains.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rego and how to employ OPA to inject policy as code into my supply chains.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project wanting to improve its supply chain security posture.
